### Procedure

1. `trained_model.Rmd` will take in human ratings on subset of museumstation dataset and raw spatial / shape errors 
generated by `calculate_shape_spatial.ipynb` in `tracing_eval`. It will train a LMER model to predict these human ratings 
on the full subset of the museum data. It will also save the model parameters in an `.rda` file so they can be directly used 
to predict ratings from other spatial / error measurements for other tracings. 

2. `model_pred.Rmd` applies the learned model to other tracings and outputs a rating (in range 0-4) for each tracing.
